To evaluate the performance of algorithms on POTS datasets, a benchmarking toolkit is necessary, hence the ecosystem library BenchPOTS is developed.
BenchPOTS provides the standard and unified preprocessing pipelines of a variety of POTS datasets.
It supports a variety of evaluation tasks to help users understand the performance of different algorithms.

## ❖ Citing BenchPOTS/PyPOTS
The paper introducing PyPOTS is available [on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18811),
A short version of it is accepted by the 9th SIGKDD international workshop on Mining and Learning from Time Series ([MiLeTS'23](https://kdd-milets.github.io/milets2023/))).
**Additionally**, PyPOTS has been included as a [PyTorch Ecosystem](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/) project.
We are pursuing to publish it in prestigious academic venues, e.g. JMLR (track for
[Machine Learning Open Source Software](https://www.jmlr.org/mloss/)). If you use PyPOTS in your work,
please cite it as below and 🌟star this repository to make others notice this library. 🤗

There are scientific research projects using PyPOTS and referencing in their papers.
