# TimeAutoDiff
This is the Github repository for code implementation of the TimeAutoDiff model (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16028).
Thanks for your interest in our model! 
In the Model Code file, we have the following py-files.

<p> 1. DP.py: This file is for splitting the dataset. We have two data splitters: one for single-sequence data (i.e., splitData.py), and another for multi-sequence data (i.e., partition_multi_seq.py).<br>
